        <p>The Generics Goodies Band originated in 1989 with two members, Gary "The Frog" Swanson and Ray Schnarr. With
            the "Frog" on keyboards and Schnarr on guitar and vocals, they needed some rhythm, they added "The Great
            Piersono" for drums and laughs. As time has progressed the band has evolved into a multimusical extravaganza
            covering music from the forties to the nineties spread over a vast range of genres from country to pop rock.
            The current nucleus of the band consists of Gary "The Frog" Swanson, keyboards; Ray Schnarr "Schnarsky"
            guitar & vocals; Ray "The Great Piersono" Pierson percussion and humor, Larry "Uncle Lar" Kuepker, drums,
            vocals & Chicken Suit, Marilyn, "Tape Lady." Younger saxophone, Virjean "Sweetie" Haywood, vocals John
            "Jonny" Loftus , Lead Guitar. The band increases in size up to 9 or 10 pieces depending on the gig
            requirement. This album is a culmination of all the years and all the members who have contributed to the
            fun and good music and entertainment that has been this bands quest to provide since its inception in 1989.
            Thanks to all who have listened, laughed, danced and applauded our efforts to make you forget your problems
            for just a few hours, this ones for you.

        <p>According to the FDA, all drugs consist of brand name drugs and generic drugs, which should work well and be
            safe. Generic drugs utilize the same active ingredients as their brand name equivalent and hence have the
            same risks and benefits. Many people are worried about the value of generic drugs. To guarantee safety,
            quality, and effectiveness, the FDA places all generic drugs during a detailed reassess method including a
            review of scientific information about the elements and performance of the standard drug. Additionally, the
            FDA needs that a basic medicine built-up plant meets the same high standards as a place for a brand name
            medicine. About half of all generic medicines are made by brand name companies. They can make copies of
            their own medications or other companyâ€™s brand medicines and then sell them without the brand name. PDG
            supports Generic Drug Development.
